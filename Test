Certainly! Below is a concise section you can add to your **Mid-Year Review** to demonstrate progress towards the **"Manage Risk"** goal, tailored to your work:

---

### ‚úÖ **Progress Towards ‚ÄúManage Risk‚Äù Goal**

* **Platform Upgrades**: Completed **two rounds of Apache Tomcat and JDK upgrades**, along with Spring framework upgrades (Spring Boot, Web, WebMVC) to **eliminate security vulnerabilities** and address **NPT risks** across Silver modules.

* **Disaster Recovery (DR) Readiness**: Successfully executed **ARC testing** to validate **TML-to-DR failover**, ensuring business continuity and minimizing operational risk.

* **Configuration Segregation**: Isolated **logger and configuration files per environment** (Dev/QA/Prod) to prevent config leaks and reduce deployment errors.

* **Production Fixes & Prevention**:

  * Fixed critical **L3 issue** in `tmltradeload` to `GMI` stop script ‚Äî preventing further job failures.
  * Resolved **NVAP trade mismatch** caused by incorrect `fstat7`, reducing financial reporting risk.
  * Implemented a **stub FTP solution** to handle file processing when the FTP server was unavailable, ensuring continuity in data flow.

* **Compliance**: Addressed and resolved a **PCAT quarantine violation**, ensuring alignment with regulatory and audit standards.

* **Test Coverage & Automation**: Improved unit test coverage and built **log verification automation**, reducing the risk of undetected failures in TML processes.

Would you like this merged into the earlier mid-year summary or formatted for a goal tracker or self-appraisal system (like Workday, SuccessFactors, etc.)?




Sure! Here's your **complete, polished Mid-Year Review** that captures all your contributions clearly and professionally:

---

## üóì **Mid-Year Review Summary (Jan ‚Äì Jun 2025)**

---

### ‚úÖ **System Upgrades & Technical Enhancements**

* Successfully **upgraded Apache Tomcat and JDK** versions to resolve NPT-related issues in the **TML GUI** application.
* Applied **Java configuration updates** to align with new deployment standards across environments.
* Completed **Spring Boot**, **Spring WebMVC**, and **Spring Web** upgrades for all **Silver modules** (**TMLZ-5432**) to address identified vulnerabilities. The updated versions were released successfully.

---

### üß™ **Testing & Unit Test Coverage**

* Developed and completed **JUnit test cases** for multiple components:

  * `SilverFileLoader`
  * `TML_Notification`
  * `TML_LegacyFileLoader`
  * `TMLFileLoader`
  * `TML_Status`
  * `TML_HighAvailabilityAggregation`
  * `SilverCommon` module
  * `TML APS` module ‚Äì achieved test coverage goals.
* Designed and implemented an **automation script** to verify logs for all TML processes, improving debugging efficiency.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Production Support & L3 Fixes**

* Resolved **L3 issue**: `tmltradeload` to `GMI` stop script was failing ‚Äì root cause identified and script fixed.
* Provided **support for Rota-based L3 issues** with timely resolutions and impact analysis.

---

### üîÅ **Automation & Configuration Improvements**

* Developed a **stub-based TML FTP file reader** as a temporary workaround due to FTP server unavailability; the rest of the process flow remained unchanged.
* Separated **logger and configuration settings** by environment (Dev, QA, Prod) to enhance maintainability and reduce risk of misconfiguration.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **NVAP & Trade Matching Issue**

* Fixed an NVAP production issue where **trades were averaged but not matched off** due to an incorrect `fstat7` value.
* Applied a code-level fix and currently conducting **multi-region testing** (APAC, AMRS, EMEA) to ensure stability and correctness prior to release.

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Disaster Recovery & Compliance**

* Successfully conducted **ARC testing** for **TML to DR server** failover readiness.
* Resolved **PCAT quarantine violation** with proper code corrections and documentation to ensure compliance.

---

### üíº **Feature Development & Fixes**

* Worked on the **TML GUI OMS tab** to address tab rendering issues ‚Äî analysis and development in progress.

---

### ü§ù **Collaboration & Recovery Testing**

* Participated in **Vendor Integration Recovery Testing** as part of resilience validation efforts.
* Actively collaborated with internal and external teams during DR planning and integration tests.

---

### üìö **Self-Learning & Volunteering**

* Ongoing personal upskilling in:

  * **Spring Security**
  * **Docker**
  * **Kubernetes** via **Udemy** courses.
* Participated in team **volunteer activities**, including **chart preparation** and creative contributions to team-building initiatives.

Would you like a **shorter summary version**, or a version aligned to a specific performance rating scale (like ‚ÄúExceeds Expectations,‚Äù etc.)?




Certainly! Here's **one clear acceptance criterion** in **Given‚ÄìWhen‚ÄìThen** format:

---

### ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criterion:**

```
Given a 2-hour recovery testing window is scheduled,  
When the Wipro associate initiates BCP by sending an invocation email to the Recovery PoC,  
Then the Recovery PoC must acknowledge the email and begin supporting the AIT work during the testing period.
```

---

Let me know if you need it tailored further or added to a full story format.



Sure! Here's a concise version of the **JIRA Story Description**:

---

### ‚úÖ **Description (Short Version):**

Supporting BAU for the vendor during recovery site testing for AIT. As part of BCP, Wipro associates will initiate and revoke BCP via email, coordinate with the Recovery PoC, and collect required screenshots (MyInfo login, AIT console at start, mid, and end). Artifacts will be compiled and validated by BCP team leads post-testing.

---

Let me know if you need this formatted for a JIRA ticket or want the acceptance criteria too.




Thanks! Here‚Äôs the updated and more accurate version of the email, including the point about licensing:

**Subject:** Request to Join Moderne CLI/DX Pilot ‚Äì TML\_GUI Application

Hi Team,

We would like to express our interest in participating in the Moderne CLI/DX Pilot. Please find our details below:

---

**1. AIT/SPK:** 24271 ‚Äì TML
**2. Module/Application:**

* **Application Name:** TML\_GUI (Angular frontend and REST services)
* **Repository:** \[Bitbucket repo link ‚Äì please insert if available]
* **Server:** Apache Tomcat

**3. Team SPOC and Members:**

* **SPOC:** \[Your Name]
* **Team Members:** \[List of members with emails if needed]

**4. Use-Case for PoC:**
We have raised an ERP to address a **Spring Framework path traversal vulnerability**. While the commercial version **Spring 5.3.41** is available, the necessary **licensing is yet to be procured by the central team**.

In parallel, we are planning a **PoC to migrate our application from JDK 8 to JDK 21**. The PoC will focus on:

* Assessing and applying automated refactoring support for Spring upgrade
* Identifying and remediating JDK 8 to 21 compatibility issues using Moderne‚Äôs capabilities

We are keen to leverage Moderne‚Äôs CLI and Developer Experience tools to streamline this modernization and reduce manual effort.

Please review our request and let us know the next steps for onboarding.

Best regards,
\[Your Full Name]
\[Your Designation]
\[Your Email]
\[Your Contact Number]
